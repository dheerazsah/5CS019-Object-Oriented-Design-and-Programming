/* Try, catch, and finally keywordÂ is implemented in this program. 
The try block is first executed. If an arithmetic error occurs while 
dividing a by b, the program moves to the catch block. The catch block
is not executed if no exception occurs. Finally, the finally block is run.
Whether or not there is an exception, the finally block is executed. */
