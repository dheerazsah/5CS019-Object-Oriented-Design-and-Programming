# 5CS019-Object Oriented Design and Programming
 This repository contains the weekly tutorials, workshops and assignments of module Object Oriented Design and Programming.

Object-Oriented Design and Programming (OODP) is a software engineering methodology that focuses on the design and development of software systems using objects. It is an approach to software development that emphasizes the creation of reusable components that can be used in multiple applications.

OODP is based on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These principles allow developers to create software systems that are easier to maintain and extend.
